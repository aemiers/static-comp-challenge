# Static Comp Challenge

The challenge is to become a CSS wizard by matching the given comp with HTML and CSS. A little creative freedom was allowed, permitting me to create a travel website instead of the details provided in the comp.

The website is also completely responsive, enabling those browsing the web on tablets or mobile devices to view this page.

## Launch

View the program on GitHub pages -> 
https://aemiers.github.io/static-comp-challenge/

Clone the repo to your local machine and launch the index.html file in your browser.
